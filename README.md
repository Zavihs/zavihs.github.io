================

This is a simple website project I am building to learn various web related technologies. 
Created using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and some JQuery (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). Also main contain some miscellaneous libraries such as the ng-infinite-scroll Angular library. Since Github pages cannot execute php files, the "Send us a message" functionality will not work as expected.
