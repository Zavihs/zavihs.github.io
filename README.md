================
This git repo is outdated since github pages can only host front end content (I havent pushed recent changes I made).
The website's backend(display tweets, contact form etc) functionality has been completed, additional front-end modifications has been made as well. The website is viewable in its complete form at www.gabusinessgroup.com

This is a simple website project I am building to learn various web related technologies. 
Created using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and some JQuery (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). Also main contain some miscellaneous libraries such as the ng-infinite-scroll Angular library. Since Github pages cannot execute php files, the "Send us a message" functionality will not work as expected.
