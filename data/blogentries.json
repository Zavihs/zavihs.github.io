Mr Fan and Mr. Hou are both working for China Jiangxi Copper Company (JCC); the largest copper producer in China. The former is the Chief Engineer of JCC, and the latter is the President of Geological Exploration Company of JCC, a subsidiary of JCC. I worked with both of them back in 1991 when I worked as a geological engineer with Jiangxi Bureau of Mineral Exploration for Nonferrous Metals. At that time, JCC was big, but never in a scale like it is today Established in 1979, JCC has gone through 34 years development, and is now the largest copper producer and copper fabricator in China, also a fundamental supplier for gold, silver, selenium, tellurium, rhenium, as well as sulphide chemicals. The company represents the flagship of China’s copper industry. It ranks as 3rd in global cathode producers. The company’s business scope is highly expanded to span non-ferrous metal, fine chemical, machinery manufacturing, logistics, futures and brokerage, geological exploration, shafts & tunnels construction, as well as international trades, covering more than 200 products. The company runs 8 mines, 3 smelters, 6 copper fabrication companies, 3 precious metal and rare earth metal producers, as well as other supportive and supplementary operations including JCCL Financial Co., Ltd., Jin Rui Futures Company, JCCL Logistics Company, etc. The company’s cathode capacity grows from 200,000 to 900,000 ton per year; total assets expands from 11 billion to 46 billion RMB ; sales income grows from 4.72 billion to 60.58 billion RMB; pre-tax profit increases from 430 million to 8,300 million RMB, net profit increases from 60 million to 3470 million RMB. What really amazed me is Jiangxi Copper’s aggressiveness in overseas investment. For the last a few years, Mr. Fan and Mr. Hou have gone over 25 countries to look for potential projects, these countries include Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Philippines, Ghana, Malawi, USA, Canada, Mexico, Peru etc. Speaking of the challenges of going overseas, Mr. Hou agrees that the understanding of target countries’ political environment, policy, and legal system are important factors they consider. As the core of Chinese culture, friendship and relationship are instrumental too. Given their tight schedule, we spent almost every day together to talk about our good old days, our future dreams, our businesses, and potential future cooperate opportunities. This is just a strong evidence how we Chinese value that friendship and relationship. Given all the resources available for JCC and its efforts, I am not surprised to see Jiangxi Copper become one of the top 5 mining groups in the world in 10 years.",

      "body": "China's MMG sees copper price steady, zinc market balanced (Reuters) Updated: 2013-11-08 13:42 Counter:14 Chinese metals producer MMG Ltd expects copper prices to hold around current levels in the medium term, with the market supported by solid growth in demand and new mines ramping up more slowly than projected. In contrast, MMG expects zinc prices to rise as demand growth is set to outpace supply as several older mines outside China shut down and miners struggle to develop new supply sources. MMG Chief Executive Andrew Michelmore said he sees copper prices holding in the low $7,000 a tonne range, which is around the current LME 3-month copper price of $7,172 a tonne, or $3.25 a pound. \"I don't see the basis for any wild swing up or down,\" he said in an interview for the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. \"You had people talking $8,500, $10,000, $12,000. I think that heat has come out of it.\" MMG, listed in Hong Kong and headquartered in Melbourne, is an arm of China Minmetals Corp that has been anointed to drive the company's western expansion in base metals. It produces copper and zinc, with mines in Australia, Laos and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Its Century zinc mine in Australia is the world's third-largest. Copper prices are being driven down by traders shorting the market on the view that too much supply will be coming on, such as from Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine and scrap metal supplies in China, Michelmore said, adding that view would probably be proven wrong. \"So I think the market's probably overestimating the rate at which supply's going to come on, and that will create uncertainty in the market.\" He does not see African and Asian copper mines, other than Oyu Tolgoi, having much impact on global supply in the medium term, but said MMG is still interested in expanding in both Africa and South America. \"The South American belt is the interesting one in terms of significant volumes of metal that could come on,\" he said, pointing to the Las Bambas, Constancia and Toromocho projects in Peru and the Disputada project in Chile, among others. Sources have said MMG is leading one of two Chinese consortiums bidding for the Las Bambas mine that Glencore Xstrata has put up for sale. Michelmore declined to comment on the Las Bambas auction. On the demand side, he saw Chinese appetite for copper picking up in 2014. \"It's not going to be the high growth that we've seen before. I think it's going to take another six to 12 months to pick up. But certainly confidence is improving with the new government,\" Michelmore said. China is the world's largest consumer of most commodities, including copper and zinc. SHRINKING ZINC OVERSUPPLY Michelmore said zinc prices are likely to increase as he sees the oversupply in the market shrinking sharply this year to around 50,000 tonnes or less. That's less than half the surplus forecast by The International Lead and Zinc Study Group. \"My view would be that when the numbers come out, I wouldn't be surprised if there were no surplus at the end of the year in 2013. So in 2014, you're going to start seeing it getting tighter,\" he said. He said demand growth is good, but the key questions are on the supply side, in China and in the west, where about 1 million tonnes of supply will come out of the market as several older mines shut over the next few years, including MMG's Century mine in Australia. In China, moves to improve air quality and limit heavy metals run-off into farmland are likely to affect zinc concentrate producers and smelters. \"Our view is that China could, at a certain price, be able to produce from their own mines and new mines the zinc that's needed (in China). Will they? It depends on the environmental restrictions that go on it. That might hold it back,\" he said. MMG's Dugald River zinc project in Australia, while delayed due to a reworking of the mine plan, will fill some of the gap. Beyond that, few new deposits have been identified, and where they have been, such as in Iran and South Africa, little work has been done toward developing mines, which means supply growth will lag demand growth until prices move sharply higher. \"Most of these projects need well over $1 per pound to justify any new project,\" Michelmore said, declining to comment on what price MMG was basing its Dugald River approval on. Zinc is currently around 87 cents a pound.",
