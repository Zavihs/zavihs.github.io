			<p>I recently had the pleasure to meet with my long-term friends and university classmates, Mr. Fan and Mr. Hou, who came to Vancouver, BC for a business trip March 24-29, 2013. Mr Fan and Mr. Hou are both working for  China Jiangxi Copper Company (JCC); the largest copper producer in China. The former is the Chief Engineer of JCC, and the latter is the President of Geological Exploration Company of JCC, a subsidiary of JCC. I worked with both of them back in 1991 when I worked as a geological engineer with Jiangxi Bureau of Mineral Exploration for Nonferrous Metals. At that time, JCC was big, but never in a scale like it is today</p>

			<p>Established in 1979, JCC has gone through 34 years development, and is now the largest copper producer and copper fabricator in China, also a fundamental supplier for gold, silver, selenium, tellurium, rhenium, as well as sulphide chemicals. The company represents the flagship of China’s copper industry. It ranks as 3rd in global cathode producers. The company’s business scope is highly expanded to span non-ferrous metal, fine chemical, machinery manufacturing, logistics, futures and brokerage, geological exploration, shafts & tunnels construction, as well as international trades, covering more than 200 products. The company runs 8 mines, 3 smelters, 6 copper fabrication companies, 3 precious metal and rare earth metal producers, as well as other supportive and supplementary operations including JCCL Financial Co., Ltd., Jin Rui Futures Company, JCCL Logistics Company, etc. The company’s cathode capacity grows from 200,000 to 900,000 ton per year; total assets expands from 11 billion to 46 billion RMB ; sales income grows from 4.72 billion to 60.58 billion RMB; pre-tax profit increases from 430 million to 8,300 million RMB, net profit increases from 60 million to 3470 million RMB.</p>

			<p>What really amazed me is Jiangxi Copper’s aggressiveness in overseas investment. For the last a few years, Mr. Fan and Mr. Hou have gone over 25 countries to look for potential projects, these countries include Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Philippines, Ghana, Malawi, USA, Canada, Mexico, Peru etc. Speaking of the challenges of going overseas, Mr. Hou agrees that the understanding of target countries’ political environment, policy, and legal system are important factors they consider. As the core of Chinese culture, friendship and relationship are instrumental too. Given their tight schedule, we spent almost every day together to talk about our good old days, our future dreams, our businesses, and potential future cooperate opportunities. This is just a strong evidence how we Chinese value that friendship and relationship. Given all the resources available for JCC and its efforts, I am not surprised to see Jiangxi Copper become one of the top 5 mining groups in the world in 10 years.</p>
